In homework 1, you learned how to implement a softmax classifier and vanilla neural networks. Now, we will learn how to implement ConvNets. You will begin by writing the forward and backward
passes for convolution and pooling, and then go on to train a shallow ConvNet on the CIFAR-10 dataset in Python. Next you will learn to use PyTorch, a popular open-source deep learning framework, and use it to replicate the experiments from before. \textbf{You will also be submitting a model to EvalAI - see your coding assignment for more details.}
